#let's load the tidyverse, which has the ggplot2 library
#and also bring in the midwest data, which comes with ggplot2
library(tidyverse)
data(midwest)

midwest

glimpse(midwest) #look at all the variables and their type

# The plan is to have you work on a number of different plots.
# I am going to give you minimal information and have you try to
# develop an appropriate figure.  For Part One, do not
# worry about labels, titles, or other finer aspects.  Let's just
# try to get a useful figure plotted that helps tell a story.
# In Part Two, you will work on the refinements.

### PART ONE ###
###################

## FIGURE ONE
#Create a plot to show the relationship between the percent of college educated (percollege)
#and the percent living below the poverty line (percbelowpoverty). You can add any another 
#aesthetic mappings to the plot you find interesting or useful.






## FIGURE TWO
#Create a plot to show the total number of American Indians in each state.  Note, you will
#will need to create a new variable and then a new dataset before plotting.




## FIGURE THREE
#Create a plot to show the distribution of population density (popdensity) across the different counties in
#in Illinois. 




## FIGURE FOUR
#Recreate Figure Three, but do it for each state.  Hint: use facet_wrap() to create a subplot for
#each state.




## FIGURE FIVE
#Create a boxplot showing the distribution of population totals (poptotal) across the counties
#for each state.  Color the different boxplots by state.

### PART TWO ###
#####################

#For each of the plots above, add labels and titles. As needed
#update the font size, color, etc.. See the end of the script for
#this week for more information
